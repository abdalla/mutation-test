# Mutation Test
This project is used to do some POCs around mutation tests.

It could be used as an example to do it in your own project.

It is using [go-mutesting](https://github.com/zimmski/go-mutesting), so you have to install it.

Disclaimer: Probably there is some better lib to do mutation tests in go, don't assume that go-mutesting is better based on this repo.

## How To Use

```
make test	
```

To do some tests around it, you can take a look at the comments inside the code and change and run the tests again.

Hope you enjoy it and let's use mutation tests.
